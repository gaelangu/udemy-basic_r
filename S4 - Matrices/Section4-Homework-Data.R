#Dear Student,
#
#Welcome to the dataset for the homework exercise.
#
#Instructions for this dataset:
# You have only been supplied vectors. You will need
# to create the matrices yourself.
# Matrices:
# - FreeThrows
# - FreeThrowAttempts

#Comments:
#Seasons are labeled based on the first year in the season
#E.g. the 2012-2013 season is preseneted as simply 2012

#Free Throw Attempts per Game
myplot(FreeThrowAtt / Games)
  #players average 3 to 10 throws per game
  #most of them are under 8 after season
  #ChrisPaul attempts are quite low - 4 to 6

#Accuracy of Free Throws
myplot(FreeThrows / FreeThrowAtt)
  #between 0.5 and 1, which means it's in % form
  #ChrisPaul has the highest accuracy when it comes to free throws, but he gets the least free throws per game
  #CP should have been given more free throws
  #DwightHoward has a very low accuracy when it comes to free throws, though his field goal accuracy is the highest!

#Player Playing Style (2 vs 3 pts preference), excl Free Throws
#3. (Points - FreeThrows) / FieldGoals
myplot((Points - FreeThrows) / FieldGoals)
  #plot is between 2 and 3, so we can confirm the data is correct
  #JoeJohnson scored more 3 pointers as time went by, style changed
  #ChrisBosh started with 2 pointers and suddenly threw more 3 pointers in recent years
  #DwightHoward is accurate for field goals, not for free throws - 
    #DW consistently scores 2 pointers and he is most likely close to the net when he scores
